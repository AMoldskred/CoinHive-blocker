Superlight script that removes coin-hive from all websites. The script both cancels all requests from coinhive and removes the script from the DOM before it loads.


Coin-Hive is:
"Coinhive offers a JavaScript miner for the Monero Blockchain (Why Monero?) that you can embed in your website. Your users run the miner directly in their Browser and mine XMR for you"

This means it steals your CPU power and slows your computer down.
